#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About
<div style="text-align: justify">
Dr. Vahid Shariati is a bioinformatician with extensive expertise in genomics research across several species. Over 10 years at Iran’s National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), he has led whole genome, pan-genome, transcriptome, and meta-analysis projects in human, plants, and bacteria species. Recently, his focus pivots to human cancer research, employing meta-nalysis, artificial intelligence (AI), and multi-omics integration to identify cancer development and progression mechanisms, biomarkers, and develop predictive models. Moreover, his experience as a full-stack developer enables him to design scalable pipelines, databases, and tools for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and genomics data.
