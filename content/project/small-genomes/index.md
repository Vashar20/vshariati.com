leveraging high-resolution genome sequencing and annotation to decode the functional and evolutionary landscapes of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. By systematically assembling and annotating small genomes across diverse taxa and ecological niches, the project uncovers conserved metabolic pathways, virulence factors, and niche-specific adaptations.

Comparative genomics identifies horizontal gene transfer events, antimicrobial resistance markers, and core/accessory genome dynamics, while phylogenetic analysis traces evolutionary relationships and biogeographic spread. Custom pipelines for de novo assembly, functional annotation, and pangenome construction prioritize scalability and reproducibility, enabling rapid characterization of unculturable or understudied species. The resulting open-access database bridges gaps in microbial taxonomy, pathogen surveillance, and ecological modeling, empowering research in infectious disease, biotechnology, and ecosystem resilienceâ€”transforming small genomes into big insights for global health and sustainability.
