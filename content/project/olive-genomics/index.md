Project harnesses global genome and transcriptome sequencing of olive genotypes to decode biodiversity, evolutionary adaptation, and human-driven migration patterns. By assembling high-resolution datasets from wild and cultivated varieties across continents, the project maps genetic diversity hotspots, identifies loci underpinning traits like drought tolerance and fruit yield, and reconstructs ancient dispersal routes shaped by trade and agriculture.

Phylogenomic analyses resolve population structures and divergence timelines, while machine learning links genomic signatures to environmental pressures. Bridging conservation genomics with precision agriculture, this initiative creates an open-access resource to safeguard olive heritage, optimize breeding, and ensure resilience in a changing climate—preserving the olive’s legacy as a cornerstone of ecology, culture, and cuisine.
