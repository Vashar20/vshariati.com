The Cancers Meta-analysis Project integrates comprehensive transcriptome, genome, and epigenome datasets to advance precision oncology through rigorous meta-analysis and cutting-edge AI models. Focused on high-impact cancers—including gastric, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancers—this initiative identifies robust biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and molecular patterns by harmonizing multi-dimensional, large-scale data sources. By analyzing interactions between genomic alterations, transcriptomic activity, and epigenetic modifications, the project uncovers deeper insights into cancer biology. Combining statistical rigor with machine learning, it prioritizes reproducibility and clinical relevance, refining diagnostics, prognostics, and tailored treatment strategies for these complex malignancies through a holistic, multi-omics approach.
