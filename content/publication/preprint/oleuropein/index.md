abstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, highlighting the Critical need for innovative treatment strategies. Phytochemicals, bioactive compounds derived from plants, have emerged as promising candidates in cancer therapy due to their diverse anti-cancer properties. Oleuropein, a polyphenol found in olive oil, has shown potential in modulating key signaling pathways, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting metastasis in various cancer models. In this study, we investigated the effects of oleuropein on genome expression profile of MDA-MB-231 BC cell line by RNA-sequencing method. The cell line treated with 200 μL of oleuropein for 48 hours, total RNA extracted from both treated and untreated cells and RNA sequencing performed to assess global gene expression changes. Differential Gene Expression (DEG) analysis was conducted to evaluate pharmacological effects of Oleuropein treatment through pathway analysis and deep learning models. A comprehensive RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a total of 137 differentially expressed genes in MDA-MB-231cells treated with oleuropein. Of these, 115 genes were downregulated, while 21 genes were upregulated during the study. These findings suggest that oleuropein exerts a significant impact on breast cancer cells by modulating multiple molecular mechanisms. The downregulation of numerous genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and invasion pathways indicates the potential for oleuropein to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in BC.
