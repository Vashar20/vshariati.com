abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its aggressive nature, high metastatic potential, and lack of effective targeted therapies. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent immunostimulatory cytokine capable of inducing strong antitumor immune responses; however, its systemic administration is limited by severe dose-dependent toxicities. A strategy enabling tumor-restricted IL-12 expression could unlock its therapeutic potential while ensuring safety. Here, we developed a tumor-responsive mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) platform engineered to selectively deliver IL-12 within the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby maximizing efficacy and minimizing systemic exposure. Through a comprehensive meta-analysis of RNA-seq and microarray datasets, we identified one of the most robustly upregulated genes in tumorassociated MSCs (TA-MSCs). Human bone marrow–derived MSCs were subsequently engineered to express single-chain IL-12 (scIL-12) under the transcriptional control of the best selected gene promoter. Intratumoral administration of engineered MSC in the syngeneic 4T1 TNBC mouse model significantly inhibited primary tumor growth, prolonged survival (80% survival at day 35 vs. <30% in controls), and reduced lung metastases by over 70%. The treatment was well tolerated, showing no systemic toxicity or adverse effects. Biodistribution analyses confirmed MSC persistence in tumors and selective IL-12 expression in metastatic lung tissue without affecting normal organs. Mechanistically, therapy elevated serum IL-12 and IFN-γ levels, enhanced CD3⁺, CD4⁺, and CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration, and reduced FOXP3⁺ regulatory T cells, collectively reprogramming the TME toward an immuneactivated state. Notably, unmodified MSCs (MSC/Mock) accelerated tumor progression, underscoring the necessity of therapeutic reprogramming. This study provides the first evidence of promoter–regulated cytokine delivery using engineered MSCs, supporting promoter-restricted, MSC-based immuno-gene therapy as a next-generation approach for aggressive solid tumors such as TNBC.
