abstract: Diet and exercise are two critical factors that regulate gut microbiota, affecting weight management. The present study investigated the effect of 10 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and a high-protein diet (HPD) on gut microbiota composition and body weight changes in obese male Wistar rats. Forty obese rats were randomly divided into five groups, including HPD, HIIT + HPD, HIIT + high-fat diet (HFD) (continuing HFD during intervention), obese control 1 (continuing HFD during intervention), obese control 2 (cutting off HFD at the beginning of the intervention and continuing standard diet), and eight non-obese Wistar rats as a non-obese control (NOC) group (standard diet). Microbial community composition and diversity analysis by sequencing 16S rRNA genes derived from the fecal samples, body weight, and Lee index were assessed. The body weight and Lee index in the NOC, HIIT + HFD, HPD, and HIIT + HPD groups were significantly lower than that in the OC1 and OC2 groups along with the lower body weight and Lee index in the HPD and HIIT + HPD groups compared with the HIIT + HFD group. Also, HFD consumption and switching from HFD to a standard diet or HPD increased gut microbiota dysbiosis. Furthermore, HIIT along with HFD increased the adverse effects of HFD on gut microbiota, while the HIIT + HPD increased microbial richness, improved gut microbiota dysbiosis, and changed rats’ phenotype to lean. It appears that HFD discontinuation without doing HIIT does not improve gut microbiota dysbiosis. Also, the HIIT + HFD, HPD, and HIIT + HPD slow down HFD-induced weight gain, but HIIT + HPD is a more reliable strategy for weight management due to its beneficial effects on gut microbiota composition.
