abstract: A deep search of RNA-seq published data shed light on thirty-nine experiments associated with the olive transcriptome, four of these proved to be ideal for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis confirmed the genes identified in previous studies and released new genes, which were not identified before. According to the IDR index, the meta-analysis had good power to identify new differentially expressed genes. The key genes were investigated in the metabolic pathways and were grouped into four classes based on the biosynthetic cycle of fatty acids and factors that affect oil quality. Galactose metabolism, glycolysis pathway, pyruvate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were the main pathways in olive oil quality. In galactose metabolism, raffinose is a suitable source of carbon along with other available sources for carbon in fruit development. The results showed that the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA in glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism is a stable pathway to begin the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Key genes in oleic acid production as an indicator of oil quality and critical genes that played an important role in production of triacylglycerols were identified in different developmental stages. In the minor compound, the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis was investigated and important enzymes were identified as an interconnected network that produces important precursors for the synthesis of a monoterpene, diterpene, triterpene, tetraterpene, and sesquiterpene biosynthesis.
