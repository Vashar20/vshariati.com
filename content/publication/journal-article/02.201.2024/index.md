abstract: The balanced fatty acid profile of olive oil not only enhances its stability but also contributes to its positive effects on health, making it a valuable dietary choice. Olive oil's high content of unsaturated fatty acids and low content of saturated fatty acids contribute to its beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The quantities of these fatty acids in olive oil may fluctuate due to various factors, with genotype being a crucial determinant of the oil's quality. This study investigated the genetic basis of oil quality by comparing the transcriptome of two Iranian cultivars with contrasting oil profiles; Mari, known for its high oleic acid content, and Shengeh, characterized by high linoleic acid at Jaén index four. Gas chromatography confirmed a significant difference in fatty acid composition between the two cultivars. Mari exhibited significantly higher oleic acid content (78.48%) compared to Shengeh (48.05%), while linoleic acid content was significantly lower in Mari (4.76%) than in Shengeh (26.69%). Using RNA sequencing at Jaén index four, we analyzed genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Differential expression analysis identified 2775 genes showing statistically significant differences between the cultivars. Investigating these genes across nine fundamental pathways involved in oil quality led to the identification of 25 effective genes. Further analysis revealed 78 transcription factors and 95 transcription binding sites involved in oil quality, with BPC6 and RGA emerging as unique factors. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying oil quality in olive cultivars. The findings have practical implications for olive breeders and producers, potentially streamlining cultivar selection processes and contributing to the production of high-quality olive oil.
