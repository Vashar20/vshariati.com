abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from gram negative bacteria cell wall is known to cause ruminal acidosis and/or infectious diseases such as metritis and mastitis which has a significant negative impact on the reproductive performance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of LPS on oocyte maturation and subsequent development in vitro. Ovine cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in a medium supplemented with 0 (control), 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/mL LPS. Nuclear maturation, cleavage and blastocyst rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and changes to the transcript abundance were evaluated. In case of the maturation rate, the percentage of oocytes reaching the MII stage was lower following exposure to 10 μg/mL LPS in comparison to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the blastocyst rate decreased in case of 1 and 10 μg/mL LPS when compared to the control group (P < 0.05). ROS overproduction accompanied by a decreased ΔΨm were recorded in LPS treated oocytes in comparison to the control group (P < 0.05). The 3′ tag digital gene expression profiling method revealed that 7887 genes were expressed while only seven genes exhibited changes in the transcript abundance following exposure to LPS. Tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25), Tripartite motif containing 26 (TRIM26), Zona Pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3), Family with sequence similarity 50-member A (FAM50A), Glyoxalate and hydroxy pyruvate reductase (GRHPR), NADH ubiquinase oxireductase subunit A8 (NDUFA8) were down-regulated (P < 0.05), while only Centrin 3 (CETN3) was up-regulated (P < 0.05). Our findings show that LPS has undesirable effects on the maturation competence of ovine oocytes and subsequent embryo development. In addition, the transcriptomic profiling results may shed more light on the molecular mechanisms of LPS-induced infertility in ruminants.
